Breaking the Roulette

### Introduction:
The Breaking the Roulette project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of winning the casino roulette game. The project uses simulations of 1 million casino roulette games to test the effectiveness of the martingale strategy under ideal conditions, assuming infinite money and no table limits.

### Simulation Setup:
To evaluate the effectiveness, the Breaking the Roulette project uses simulations of 1 million casino roulette games. The simulation assumes an American roulette table with 37 slots, including 18 red, 18 black, and 1 green slots (0). The simulation uses a random number generator to simulate the ball's landing on the roulette wheel.

### Assumptions:
The simulation assumes ideal conditions, such as infinite money, no table limits, and perfect betting conditions. In real-world scenarios, these assumptions are not valid, and winning the casino roulette game may not be possible.

### Evaluation:
The evaluation of the effectiveness involves analyzing the simulation's outcomes. The simulation records the number of games played, the number of wins and losses, and the maximum bet placed. The simulation also records the net profit or loss from the betting strategy.

### Results:
The results of the Breaking the Roulette project indicate that winning the casino roulette game under ideal conditions is possible. Out of 1 million simulated games, the betting strategy won 52.4% of the games and lost 47.6% of the games. The net profit from the strategy was $2,763,915. The maximum bet placed during the simulation was $81,920, and the maximum consecutive loss streak was 12.

### Summary data, for 1 Million simulations.
- The average win is over 1.3k
- The average lowest wallet per game was 39k
- The average total spent per game was 79k
- The lowest player wallet during the game was 17 Trillion
- The highest win after the game was 33.5 Million
Specific colors were rolled:
- Red was rolled (min: 2, max: 7, avg: 4.72)
- Black was rolled (min: 0, max: 29, avg: 4.72)
- Green was rolled (min: 0, max: 6, avg: 0.26)

### Conclusion:
The Breaking the Roulette project's results show that beating the casino roulette game under ideal conditions is possible. However, the assumptions of infinite money and no table limits are not valid in real-world scenarios, and winning the game may not be feasible. It is essential to exercise caution and responsible gambling practices while playing casino games.
